## Enclosure

The system components are housed inside a protective enclosure suitable for outdoor use.

The enclosure was selected to:
- Protect electronics from dust and moisture
- Allow safe cable entry and exit
- Support mounting of power components and controller
- Enable maintenance access when required

Cable glands and sealed openings are used to prevent water ingress.
Internal spacing was arranged to separate power electronics from low-voltage logic components.

The enclosure design prioritizes functionality and protection rather than aesthetics, with plans to optimize layout in a future PCB-based revision.
