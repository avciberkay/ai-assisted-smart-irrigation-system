## Battery Enclosure (3D Model)

This enclosure is designed specifically to house the 4S3P lithium-ion battery pack used in the system.

The goal of this model is to demonstrate practical 3D design skills for embedded power systems, with focus on safety, fit, and printability rather than mass production.

Design considerations:
- Secure placement of cylindrical cells to prevent movement
- Internal spacing to reduce heat buildup
- Dedicated exit path for power cables
- Simple geometry suitable for FDM 3D printing
- No assumptions about IP rating or industrial certification

This enclosure represents a functional prototype design.
It is intended to show mechanical design capability and understanding of battery safety constraints.
