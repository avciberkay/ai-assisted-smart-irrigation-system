## Wiring Overview

The system was built as a functional prototype using direct wiring instead of a custom PCB.

All power and signal connections were made manually to allow rapid iteration and testing.
This approach enabled flexible debugging and hardware changes during development.

Wiring considerations:
- Separate power and signal paths to reduce noise
- Secure connections for outdoor operation
- Clear routing between sensors, controller, and actuators
- Protection against accidental short circuits

While a custom PCB is planned as a future iteration, the current wiring layout proved reliable during long-term testing and real-world operation.
