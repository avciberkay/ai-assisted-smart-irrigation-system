## Power System Overview

The power subsystem is a core component of the smart irrigation system and is designed for autonomous, long-term operation.

The system does not rely on a single power source. Instead, it integrates multiple energy inputs and manages them at the hardware level without human intervention.

Primary characteristics:
- Multi-source power input architecture
- Automatic source selection and prioritization
- Battery charging and protection handled in hardware
- Stable power delivery to both logic and motor loads

The power system was designed to keep the system operational under changing environmental and grid conditions and to minimize maintenance requirements in real-world deployments.
