## Scaling Ideas

The current system is designed for a small number of devices and a single deployment.

Potential scaling improvements:
- Support multiple irrigation zones and device groups.
- Introduce a database for long-term sensor data storage and analytics.
- Use message queues to handle higher data throughput.
- Deploy services across multiple containers or servers.
- Add monitoring and alerting for system health.

These ideas outline possible future extensions and are not part of the current implementation.
