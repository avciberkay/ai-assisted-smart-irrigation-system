## Docker Setup

Docker is used to containerize all backend services in this project.

Services are orchestrated using Docker Compose.
This allows the backend to be reproducible and easy to deploy on a VPS.

A sanitized `docker-compose.example.yml` file is provided as a reference.
It documents service structure and ports without exposing secrets.
